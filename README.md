# ADubhlaoich's Noise Machine
Welcome to [my](https://www.adubhlaoich.ie) noise machine. I think of this repository as a sandbox, or a [scratch folder](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/scratch-file) of sorts. I use it to store things I'm learning and figuring out, and to keep as reference for later use - if I'm lucky, I'll forget things. The name is inspired by the concept of a [sound system](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/wickedest-sound/), encompassing not only code itself, but also the thoughts around the code. 

Feel free to look around, but I'm unlikely to accept pull requests - this is an experiment for me to learn in public.

You can reach out to me at the e-mail address code (at) adubhlaoi (dot) ch.
